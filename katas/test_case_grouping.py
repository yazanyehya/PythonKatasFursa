def group_test_cases(test_case_group_sizes):
    """
    Groups test cases based on their specified group sizes.

    Problem:
    In software testing, we need to organize test cases into groups. Each test case must be
    placed in exactly one group, and the size of each group must match what each test case expects.

    For example, if test_case_group_sizes = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]:
    - Test case 0 needs to be in a group with exactly 1 test case (itself)
    - Test case 1 needs to be in a group with exactly 2 test cases
    - Test case 2 needs to be in a group with exactly 3 test cases
    - And so on...

    Your task is to organize all test cases into valid groups where:
    1. Every test case appears in exactly one group
    2. For each test case i, the size of its group must be exactly test_case_group_sizes[i]
    3. All test cases in the same group must have the same group size requirement

    Example explanation:
    For input [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2], a valid solution is [[0], [1, 5], [2, 3, 4]]
    - Test case 0 is in a group of size 1, as required
    - Test cases 1 and 5 are in a group of size 2, as both require
    - Test cases 2, 3, and 4 are in a group of size 3, as all three require

    Args:
        test_case_group_sizes: a list of integers, where each integer represents the
                              required group size for the corresponding test case

    Returns:
        a list of lists, where each inner list contains the indices of test cases
        that are grouped together
